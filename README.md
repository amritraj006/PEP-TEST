JavaScript & Web Development Practice Problems

This repository contains a set of practical JavaScript, HTML, and CSS problems focused on strengthening core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, arrays, functions, closures, hoisting, and responsive UI design.

📌 Problem Overview
1. DOM Manipulation – Student List

Dynamically create a <ul> and <li> elements using JavaScript

Display student names with marks

Apply background colors using DOM methods

2. Dynamic Heading Manipulation

Modify an <h1> element using JavaScript

Sort an array of objects by price in ascending order

Return a new sorted array without mutating the original data

5. Filtering Users Based on Conditions

Filter users who are active and have premium membership

Use modern JavaScript array methods

6. JavaScript Hoisting & Scope Analysis

Predict output of code involving var, let, and function scope

Explain hoisting behavior and runtime errors

Rewrite code to avoid errors and ensure valid outputs

7. Counter Using Closures

Implement a private counter using closures

Preserve state across function calls

Prevent direct access to the counter value

8. Function Hoisting Output Prediction

Analyze differences between function declarations and function expressions

Predict output and explain execution behavior
